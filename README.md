# vulnus-map-fixer

fixes broken maps on vulnus.


## how to use?
download from releases. once you have the binary, place it somewhere and open where ever it's saved in command prompt or powershell and run `vulnus-map-fixer.exe <MAPS DIRECTORY>` and it should output everything which it fixes.

### what is "MAPS DIRECTORY"?
This is where your maps are stored. it will be in your game install folder and then a folder called maps. for example mine is the following: `X:\meta\app\Vulnus_Beta_Win\maps`


## example program usage
using powershell
```pwsh
./vulnus-map-fixer.exe "X:\meta\app\Vulnus_Beta_Win\maps"
```
using cmd
```cmd
vulnus-map-fixer.exe "X:\meta\app\Vulnus_Beta_Win\maps"
```
